- **{organ}_fba_results.tsv** : a tabulated text file containing the flux for each reaction.
- **biomasses_plot.pdf** : a plot showing the convergence of biomass rates 
*(y = biomass rate for each organ, x = iteration in the feedback loop)*
- **time_series**: TO BE ADDED. Dataframe of different variables (biomass_rate, xylem flux, sucrose flux, ...) at each iteration in the feedback loop.
